\begin{problem}
{
Find the relation between the angles $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$ (in the $L$ system) after disintegrating into two particles.
}
{
The angles of the particles, in the $C$ system, are related by
\begin{equation*}
\theta_0 = \theta_{10} = \pi - \theta_{20},
\end{equation*}
where $\theta_0$ as been defined to simplify the notation. From the formulae (16.5) of the book, we have
\begin{align*}
    V + v_{10}\cos{\theta_0} &= v_{10} \sin{\theta_0} \cot{\theta_1} \\
    V - v_{20}\cos{\theta_0} &= v_{20} \sin{\theta_0} \cot{\theta_2} .
\end{align*}
We must eliminate $\theta_0$ from the two equations above. To do so, we can first and $\sin{\theta_0}$ which give us
\begin{align*}
    &\sin{\theta_0} = \frac{\left( V + v_{10}\cos{\theta_0} \right)}{v_{10}\cot{\theta_1}} = \frac{\left( V - v_{20}\cos{\theta_0} \right)}{v_{20}\cot{\theta_2}} \\
    &\Rightarrow 
\end{align*}
